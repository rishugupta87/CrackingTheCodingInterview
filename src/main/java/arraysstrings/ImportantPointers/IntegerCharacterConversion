//Here, we used '0' because chars are actually represented by ASCII values. '0' is a char and represented by value of 48.
//and in order to add these up, Java converted '0' to its ASCII value which is 48 and a is 1 so the sum is 49.
int a = 1;
char b = (char)(a + '0');
System.out.println(b); //print character corresponding to ascii value = 49 which is '1'

//will print out the char with ascii value 1 (start-of-heading char, which isn't printable).
int a1 = 1;
char b1 = (char) a1;
System.out.println(b1);

//will print out the char with ascii value 49 (one corresponding to '1')
int a2 = '1';
char b2 = (char) a2;
System.out.println(b2);

//If you want to convert a digit (0-9), you can add 48 to it and cast, or something like Character.forDigit(a, 10)
int a3 = 5;
char b3 = (char) (a3 + '0'); //= char(53) = character corresponding to ascii value 53 which is = 5
System.out.println(b3);

Ascii table: http://www.asciitable.com/
ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers,
so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.
ASCII was developed a long time ago and now the non-printing characters are rarely used for their original purpose.
Below is the ASCII character table and this includes descriptions of the first 32 non-printing characters.
ASCII was actually designed for use with teletypes and so the descriptions are somewhat obscure. If someone says
they want your CV however in ASCII format, all this means is they want 'plain' text with no formatting such as tabs,
bold or underscoring - the raw format that any computer can understand. This is usually so they can easily import
the file into their own applications without issues. Notepad.exe creates ASCII text, or in MS Word you can
save a file as 'text only'

Ascii value can be between 0 -127
Extended value till 255
= 0 - 255  = 256 ascii characters possible.

Unicode: http://www.unicodetables.com/
Ascii was very simplistic, and so was extended by adding 'extended' sets by various manufacturers.
Apart from being confusing this was still restricted to 256 characters. Now computers are more widely
established around the world the need to show other characters such as Japanese and Chinese languages along with
various symbols became more important. Unicode is an attempt to standardise every character possible and the latest version (4)
is shown below. Tables are in PDF format so you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader to view them.
