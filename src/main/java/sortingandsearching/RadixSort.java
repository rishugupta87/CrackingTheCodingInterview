/**
  Radix Sort IRuntime: O( kn)
  (see below)
  Radix sort is a sorting algorithm for integers (and some other data types) that takes advantage of the fact that
  integers have a finite number of bits. In radix sort, we iterate through each digit of the number, grouping numbers by
  each digit. For example, if we have an array of integers, we might first sort by the first digit, so that the Os are grouped
  together. Then, we sort each of these groupings by the next digit. We repeat this process sorting by each subsequent digit.
  until finally the whole array is sorted.
  Unlike comparison sorting algorithms, which cannot perform better than 0 (n log (n)) in the average case, radix sort has a
  runtime of O( kn), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of passes of the sorting algorithm.
