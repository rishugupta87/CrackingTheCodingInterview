/**
   Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.

   DEFINITION
   Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to
   make a loop in the linked list.

   Input: A -) B -) C -) D -) E -) C [the same C as earlier]
   Output: C
